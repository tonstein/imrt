# Generating an ImRt Documentation

### Dependencies

- doxygen
- graphviz (to generate inheritance diagrams)

### Building

In a terminal run
```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```
from within the directory with the "Doxyfile" file.

This will create a new subdirectory "html" containing a "index.html" that you can open in your browser to access the generated documentation.
